Project Planning and Development Process
1. Objective and Goals
The goal of this project was to build a responsive, user-friendly hotel management application. It offers features such as hotel discovery, booking, user account management, and secure payment integration using modern tools and frameworks. The application also includes admin functionality for managing reservations and accommodations.

2. Tools and Technologies Used
Frontend Framework: React.js (for building the UI components and managing state)
Routing: React Router (to handle navigation between pages)
Authentication: Firebase Authentication (for secure user login and account management)
Database and Storage: Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage (for storing user data and images)
Payment Integration: Stripe.js and @stripe/react-stripe-js (for processing payments)
Styling: CSS and custom stylesheets for a responsive and visually appealing interface
Notifications: React Toastify (for showing error/success messages)
State Management: Context API (to manage authentication and user state globally)
Build Tools: Webpack (used through React scripts for bundling the application)
3. Project Structure
The application was organized into the following structure:

Components Folder:
Contains reusable components such as Home, Login, Register, Dashboard, and AdminDashboard.
Specialized components like PaymentPage and UploadPicture for additional functionality.
CSS Files:
Each component has a corresponding CSS file for component-specific styles.
Environment Variables:
Sensitive keys such as Firebase API keys and Stripe public keys are stored in the .env file for security and scalability.
4. Key Features Developed
User Authentication:

Implemented secure user login, registration, and logout using Firebase Authentication.
Used ProtectedRoute and AdminProtectedRoute to restrict access to specific routes.
Hotel Discovery and Details:

Developed components like Discover and HotelDetails to fetch and display hotel listings with detailed information.
Booking Functionality:

Created a BookNow page where users can select their stay dates and confirm bookings.
Admin Dashboard:

Built an admin interface for managing reservations and approving/declining bookings.
Account Management:

Enabled users to update their login credentials, upload profile pictures, and manage personal settings.
Payment Integration:

Integrated Stripe to securely handle payments for bookings.
Responsive Design:

Styled all pages to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
5. Development Workflow
Setup and Configuration:

Initialized the React app and configured Firebase for authentication and Firestore for database storage.
Component Development:

Built individual components incrementally, starting with core functionality (e.g., Home, Login) and adding advanced features (e.g., Stripe integration).
Styling:

Added CSS styles to ensure a clean and responsive UI.
Testing:

Tested user flows such as login, booking, payment, and admin management to ensure functionality.
Error Handling:

Implemented error messages using React Toastify for a better user experience.
Deployment:

Prepared the application for deployment by adding scripts to package.json and ensuring sensitive keys were securely managed.
6. Challenges and Solutions
Challenge: Handling secure payments with Stripe.
Solution: Used @stripe/react-stripe-js to integrate Stripe seamlessly into the application. Tested the payment flow rigorously to ensure reliability.

Challenge: Managing authentication state across components.
Solution: Leveraged the Context API to manage authentication globally.

Challenge: Ensuring a responsive design.
Solution: Used CSS flexbox and media queries to make the UI adapt to various screen sizes.

7. Outcome
The result is a fully functional, responsive hotel management application with user-friendly features and robust security measures. The project adheres to modern web development standards and provides an excellent foundation for future enhancements.
